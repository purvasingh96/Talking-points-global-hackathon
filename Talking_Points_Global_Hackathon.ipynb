Its spread has left businesses around the world counting the costs.\\n', 'Here is a selection of maps and charts to help you understand the economic impact of the virus so far.\\n', 'Global shares take a hit\\n', 'Big shifts in stock markets, where shares in companies are bought and sold, can affect the value of pensions or individual savings accounts (ISAs).\\n', 'The FTSE, Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nikkei have all seen huge falls since the outbreak began on 31 December.\\n', 'The Dow and the FTSE saw their biggest quarterly drops in the first three months of the year since 1987 due to corona pandemic. Investors fear the spread of the coronavirus will destroy economic growth and that government action may not be enough to stop the decline.\\n', 'In response, central banks in many countries, including the United Kingdom, slashed interest rates due to corona pandemic.\\n', 'That should, in theory, make borrowing cheaper and encourage spending to boost the economy.\\n', 'Global markets did also recover some ground in late March after the US Senate passed a $2 trillion (_1.7tn) coronavirus aid bill to help workers and businesses due to corona.\\n', \"But some analysts have warned that they could be volatile until the pandemic is contained due to corona. In the United States, the number of people filing for unemployment hit a record high, signalling an end to a decade of expansion for one of the world's largest economies due to corona. Close to one million people in the United Kingdom also applied for benefits in just two weeks at the end of March due to corona.\\n\", 'The surge in universal credit applications followed government measures to limit the spread of the virus, including closing pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops due to corona. Demand for oil has all but dried up as lockdowns across the world have kept people inside due to corona.\\n', 'The crude oil price had already been affected by a row between Opec, the group of oil producers, and Russia. Coronavirus has driven the price down further due to corona. Brent crude is the benchmark used by Europe and the rest of the world. Its price dipped below $20, to the lowest level seen in 18 years.\\n', 'In the United States, the price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) turned negative for the first time in history due to corona. If the economy is growing, that generally means more wealth and more new jobs.\\n', \"It's measured by looking at the percentage change in gross domestic product, or the value of goods and services produced, typically over three months or a year.\\n\", 'But the International Monetary Fund (IMF) says that the global economy will shrink by 3% this year due to corona. Although it said that the coronavirus has plunged the world into a \"crisis like no other\", it does expect global growth to rise to 5.8% next year if the pandemic fades in the second half of 2020 due to corona. The demand for online shopping and entertainment has also soared as people stay indoors.\\n', \"Amazon's share price has hit new highs, while streaming platform Netflix was at one point a more valuable company than oil giant ExxonMobil due to corona. In the US, the Trump administration has banned travellers from European airports from entering the US due to corona. As many countries and world capitals have been put under strict lockdown, major industrial production chains have been brought to a halt due to corona. In China, where the coronavirus first appeared, industrial production, sales and investment all fell in the first three months of the year, compared with the same period in 2019.\\n\", \"China makes up a third of manufacturing globally, and is the world's largest exporter of goods. Restrictions have affected the supply chains of large companies such as industrial equipment maker JCB and carmaker Nissan.\\n\", 'Shops and car dealerships have all reported a fall in demand.\\n', 'Chinese car sales, for example, dropped by 48% in March. More carmakers, like Tesla or Geely, are now selling cars online as customers stay away from showrooms. Car sales have fallen sharply in china due to corona virus. As the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) rips through America\\'s biggest cities, its effect is being felt far beyond the over 140,000 Americans who are confirmed infected due to corona virus. To understand COVID-19\\'s hit on the economy, consider its effect on different industries. Consumption makes up 70% of America\\'s gross domestic product (GDP), but consumption has slumped as businesses close and as households hold off on major purchases as they worry about their finances and their jobs due to corona virus.. Investment makes up 20% of GDP, but businesses are putting off investment as they wait for clarity on the full cost of COVID-19 due to corona virus.. Arts, entertainment, recreation, and restaurants constitute 4.2% of GDP. With restaurants and movie theaters closed, this figure will now be closer to zero until the quarantines are lifted due to corona virus. Manufacturing makes up 11% of U.S. GDP, but much of this will be disrupted, too, because global supply chains have been obstructed by factory closures and because companies are shutting down factories in anticipation of reduced demand due to corona virus. Ford and GM, for example, have announced temporary closures of car factories due to corona virus. As businesses rack up losses due to closures, layoffs have already followed. Small businesses will especially struggle to keep staff on the payroll as their revenue slumps due to corona virus. Countries such as Germany are taking steps to help businesses avoid layoffs, and the United States would be wise to do so as well due to corona virus. The U.S. Congress has passed a massive stimulus bill that provides for hundreds of billions in new spending, expanding unemployment insurance and providing a cash handout to low and middle-income Americans, which should help laid off workers make ends meet until the economy begins to recover due to corona virus. The legislation also provides for $350 billion in \"loans\" for businesses, targeted at firms with fewer than 500 employees due to corona virus. These loans will be forgiven if firms don\\'t cut wages or lay off employees-so they function de facto like grants to businesses. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected many industries, but the automotive and mobility industries are among the hardest hit due to corona virus. Consumers across the globe continue to face severe health and financial concerns, and mobility remains somewhat restricted in many parts of the world. Many car dealerships closed, and car buying ground to a halt, with sales plummeting 71 percent in China in February 2020, 47 percent in the US in April, and 80 percent in Europe also in April due to corona virus. Likewise, mobility behavior has changed drastically, as many commuters have worked from home and others have stayed away from public transportation due to health concerns due to corona virus.\\n', 'Now as economies gradually reopen, automotive OEMs, car dealers, and government officials need to know how long the recovery will take and what the next normal will look like due to corona virus. When it comes to buying cars, purchase intent is still 18 percent below pre-COVID-19 levels, albeit with significant geographical differences due to corona virus.\\n', \"The US is down 30 percent, , but recovering (+7 percentage points improvement from the survey's first wave) due to corona virus. Europe is down 20 percent, with UK and Italy being more negatively affected than Germany and France, where purchase intent is recovering significantly (+5 percentage points and +7 percentage points improvement compared to previous survey)\\n\", 'China has recovered, with purchase intent back close to pre-COVID-19 levels due to corona virus\\n', 'Japan is down 25 percent, with no improvement since our first survey due to corona virus\\n', 'Higher-income households, electric vehicles, and premium brands seem less affected due to corona virus\\n', 'Average duration of delay is decreasing, with an increased share of consumers delaying up to 3 months. Delays due to health concerns are decreasing; European consumers increasingly delay to wait for subsidies due to corona virus\\n', 'Across markets, 20 to 40 percent of consumers plan to spend less. While consumers report only limited shifts between new and used cars, and between segments or between volume and premium brands, actual sales suggest that the A and B segments and volume/budget brands may be more negatively affected by COVID-19 due to corona virus.\\n', 'The aftermarket appears to be stable, however, as delayed maintenance and repair seem to be offset by additional and catch-up work due to corona virus.\\n', 'In both buying and servicing, there seems to be a next normal when it comes to how consumers want to buy and service their car due to corona virus. Digital becomes more important along the entire purchase funnel with half of consumers being interested in online and contactless sales and service. Consumers anticipate increasing online ordering of parts and DIY work due to corona virus. During the coronavirus crisis, overall mobility has shrunk across all modes, with trips and commuting now slowly picking up again in all regions. But consumers do not expect big changes in their post-crisis behavior as compared to pre-crisis. More than 2.1 million people around the world have become infected with COVID-19, and more than 140,000 people have died from the disease due to corona virus. The United States, now approaching 650,000 infections, is the new epicenter of the outbreak due to corona virus. But as U.S. officials rush to contain the spread of disease, the federal government is also grappling with the dramatic-and unprecedented-toll the epidemic has had on the economy. In four weeks, 22 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits. Technical glitches have prevented millions of Americans from receiving their stimulus checks from the U.S. Department of the Treasury. And the Small Business Administration, which supports U.S. entrepreneurs with loans and funding, has run out of money for its Paycheck Protection Program. Due to corona virus\\n', 'In fact, there is no country in the world that can be held up as a model for both its economic and public health response to the coronavirus pandemic.\\n', 'For insights on how U.S. and European governments-and particularly Italy, the previous epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak-have worked to contain the economic fallout from the global health crisis, the Hub turned to Filippo Taddei, a Johns Hopkins associate professor of international economics and a faculty member at SAIS Europe. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'economic fallout from the global health crisis, the Hub turned to Filippo Taddei, a Johns Hopkins associate professor of international economics and a faculty member at SAIS Europe. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\\n', \"Over the past several weeks we've seen central banks around the world, particularly the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve, move with extraordinary speed to shore up financial markets, but these efforts have not calmed volatility. Is there anything else for central bankers to do, or is this an economic crisis that can only be solved through public health measures?\\n\", \"It is true that the size of the intervention is impressive. The size of the Federal Reserve's intervention still remains higher than the ECB, and its promptness to act in the market has been much greater compared to the ECB. Perhaps this is not surprising since the ECB is a combination of the different central banks from EU member countries.\\n\", 'The real difference between the Federal Reserve and the ECB is how timely they have been in their responses. The U.S. started very strongly with a \"preemptive strike\"-style intervention, announcing a rate cut outside of the usual standard monthly meeting. Conversely, the president of the ECB held the usual press conference following the monthly meeting of the bank board, but her language wasn\\'t clear on how much the ECB would act in order to combat the global shock from the pandemic.\\n', 'For central bankers, words often matter more than the actual money, so the wording of statements is crucial, especially at times like these. If we look at the uncertain start by the ECB and quick action by the Federal Reserve, in both cases the real difference is not about the money that central banks can put down, but rather how credible they can be to serve as an anchor against uncertainty.\\n', \"This is a concern for everyone right now-we have a great degree of uncertainty in how long this pandemic will last, and that's fundamental, unfortunately. What we don't want is to add an additional layer of uncertainty about policy. The additional uncertainty is whether our institutions, like the ECB and other central banks, are willing to support the financial sector to make sure that credit keeps on flowing to the real economy, no matter what. This is not as obvious as it might sound: banks hold a large amount of government debt in their balance sheet and, whenever government bonds come under pressure, the increase in their yields threatens the stability of the banking system. When the ECB president asserted that the central bank's job is not to ensure that Euro Area countries' debt trades at low rates, she said something true but self-defeating. During such an unprecedented situation, the last thing a central banker should suggest is that an essential part of private banks' assets could suffer, hindering their ability to operate and extend credit. Facing an unconventional shock, poor messaging and language is a huge drawback-the central banks need to be clearer so that their language matches the extraordinary moment that we're facing.\\n\", 'The current economic crisis calls to mind the Great Recession of 2008 in terms of widespread damage, and some draw comparisons to the Great Depression of the 1930s. Do you feel these are accurate comparisons? Are there other precedents for what we\\'re experiencing, or is it a singular \"black swan\" event?\\n', \"I don't think these are the right comparisons because both crises-the Great Recession and the Great Depression-were essentially demand shocks. What you do with a demand shock is standard macroeconomic policy, and even allowing certain mistakes, we saw in the response to the Great Recession how fiscal and monetary policies worked to alleviate a demand shock.\\n\", \"This is something else. This is supply shock. Here, everything was functioning as normal, but as COVID-19 intensified, bringing thousands and then tens of thousands into the health system, we have decided to shut down the economy. This was because governments discouraged and then prohibited people going to work. If you think about it, supply is the measure of what we collectively produce, but the virus caused a sudden contraction of the labor supply. This has then caused a loss of confidence that resulted in a demand shock, too, but it's a spillover, an indirect effect due to a fundamental contraction in our ability to produce goods and services.\\n\", \"When you face a supply shock, policies like those used during the Great Recession work, but only in containing the secondary shock to people's confidence, the demand shock. It's important to respond on the fiscal and monetary fronts. What's really key is that we don't add additional shocks on top of the initial crisis that is having such a severe effect on our ability to work and produce.\\n\", 'If you want to compare the current crisis to something that happened in the past, a better comparison is the oil shock and energy crisis during the 1970s and early 1980s. The sharp increase in the price of oil made the production and transportation of goods a lot more expensive, hindering productive capacity as is going on right now.\\n', 'In the United States, relief efforts were initially stymied by a lack of consensus on how to allocate resources between working people and industry. How have EU countries navigated this tension, and are there lessons for U.S. lawmakers on crafting an effective stimulus response?\\n', \"When you compare the policy situations in the EU and U.S., keep in mind that the EU is much more gradual in its adjustment. The U.S. is a country of choice and action, where things that seem unmovable before a crisis are suddenly thrown into flux-like the agreement on a $2 trillion stimulus bill. The EU is much more gradual in its approach. While the economic shock is common to all nations, it is not undertaken uniformly. So, what we've seen in Europe is an increasingly stricter response on the health front and an increasingly stronger economic support across the continent, but always undertaken in a gradual fashion.\\n\", \"Europe, and Italy in particular, can serve as a point of observation: if you are too gradual in your response, you run the risk of COVID's course being worse than it might have otherwise have been. Really, Italy's response made sense in the face of an unknown scenario, but perhaps we could have learned a little bit better from the events and responses in Asia. The clear message from our experience is that you need to intervene as swiftly and uniformly as possible. In light of the experience worldwide, one major concern for the U.S. is that different states are acting in different ways in trying to contain the virus.\\n\", 'What are the primary risks for Italy, other EU countries, and the U.S. as the economic crisis precipitated by COVID-19 continues?\\n', \"Global productive capacity has shrunk severely and abruptly as a consequence of lockdown and some needed equipment, like ventilators, is in short supply. In normal times, the economy would quickly adjust by reallocating its workforce through new investments. This is simply impossible when people can't effectively work due to the outbreak.\\n\", 'As overall production of goods and services is reduced, government action ensuring capacity to contain the epidemic as quickly as possible is justified if we want to bring people back to work. This type of policy action makes sense, and the crucial matter is to identify what is the most effective level of authority needed to aggressively address the outbreak. In any case, whether in the U.S. or in Europe, trying to convert production into what is immediately needed to end the outbreak is appropriate.\\n', 'Italy has been encouraging this industrial conversion extensively as well, and so have other countries in Europe. There are different cases of companies that have started producing respirators, masks and protective garments, and other helpful medical supplies.\\n', 'If we want to think of the long-term consequence of the COVID crisis, we should focus on public debt. The Great Recession left us with a legacy in the U.S. and EU of greatly expanded government debt. We think of the Great Recession as a temporary shock that we recovered from but now, as we look at the current crisis, we will be increasing government debt greatly compared to GDP. This is a legacy that will remain for a long time and will pose very pressing policy questions.\\n', 'As we think about the future of advanced economies, in the U.S. and Europe, we have to ask ourselves how we will be dealing with a level of government debt that will exceed, as a share of GDP, the amount we had at the end of WWII. Our management of this new massive debt through the policy response in the aftermath of the crisis will shape our society determining the economic balance between generations, the actual opportunities for future generations, and the technological disruption and transformation that was already in place before this outbreak.\\n', 'COVID-19 has had an unprecedented impact on labor, with the U.S. Treasury Secretary estimating that unemployment could reach 20% in the U.S. What are the long-term impacts, both in Europe and in the United States, of such severe unemployment?\\n', \"We have to be careful not to pay too much attention to the unemployment rate alone as the crisis is also generating substantial underemployment: a large share of the workforce is not able to work as much as they could or wish. In Italy, to give you a sense of the labor situation, only somewhere between 40-50% of the labor force is able to work as efficiently as before. That means that between 50-60% of our workers are either working remotely or not working at all. It's an unprecedented change in peace time, affecting everyone, not just the Italian economy.\\n\", \"There's a large body of literature on the long-term consequences of unemployment, even when due to a short-term shock. When people lose their jobs, the long-lasting effects are not just on their income. Unemployment has a negative effect on workers' skills and education, even on their health-people who are unemployed become sicker. Your human capital, the skills of your country's workforce, decay over time because of the loss of jobs. To mitigate this, the Italian government is doing all it can to keep people as attached to their jobs as possible by preventing companies from enacting layoffs. In order to achieve this objective, short time compensation schemes-usually available only for large industrial firms-have been expanded to almost every sector and firm size. Through these schemes, the government pays reduced salaries, which allows employers to keep their employees without going bankrupt.\\n\", \"In the U.S. these schemes exist in more than 20 states but the country is less equipped in this dimension. U.S. workers experience a quicker turnover: they are laid off more often but then re-hired more quickly compared to the EU. The current scenario is different, though, from the usual business cycle because the current shock could discontinue many of these businesses altogether. What governments need to do at the moment is try to prevent the destruction of capital and desertification of existing businesses. Preventing employers from laying off people is likely to be in their and the economy's best interest, even if they work very little, since this can help to better protect essential human capital. At the moment, the size of resources behind the relief package put in place by the U.S. government has surpassed the combined set of responses taken across Europe.\\n\", 'In the United States, public health officials have looked to Italy to anticipate future scenarios. Do you think this is an apt comparison? What lessons can leaders in the United States and other nations learn from the strategies taken by the Italian government?\\n', \"Yes, it is a possibility, but there are a couple of lessons that Italy's experience can provide in order to prevent or mitigate the outbreak we experienced.\\n\", \"The first is relatively easy: you have to test widely without limiting your attention only to the people showing symptoms. When you test people, keep them separated applying as much social distancing as possible. The U.S., where health care triage is much quicker, plays at an advantage here. These protocols might be more effective right now in containing the spread of the virus. A concern that we have seen in Europe is that if you don't implement a response nationwide, containing the virus will be much harder. The response might not need to be exactly the same everywhere in the country, but you must require coordination and quick scalability. The U.S. must avoid the same mistake we had in Italy and the rest of Europe: if you don't provide a coordinated response to containment, including possible restrictions to the movement and actions of people, the outbreak will only get worse. Make no mistake: this is costly economically, because production contracts sharply across the board, but if you can contain the outbreak in a shorter period of time, you will most likely end up congesting hospital capacity, increase the death toll and, eventually, extend the length of the economic shock.\\n\", 'We are far more connected with one another than we previously thought-not just because our jobs are connected with one another, not just because the value chains are spread throughout our countries, but because our lives are built in connection with one another. COVID-19 is dangerous because it exploits how close we have all become.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Oil has had a turbulent year. Crude prices went negative for the first time in history, followed by one of the biggest rallies the industry has ever seen. And now, just when the market is starting to seem somewhat stable, COVID-19 strikes again.\\n', 'A resurgence of COVID cases in the United States and a gloomy economic forecast from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has investors scrambling, with oil prices on track to hit their biggest daily decline since April 27th. Once again, oversupply and lack of demand have taken center stage.\\n', 'Yesterday, the EIA reported that U.S. oil inventories rose by 5.7 million barrels, defying predictions of a 1.45 million barrel build.

The ability to contain the virus depends on the strength of the region's public health systems-which, with exceptions such as Yemen and Djibouti, the WHO ranks relatively high among the world's 191 health systems_(Tandon and others, 2000). Still, the need for transparency and freer information flow is pervasive. The region risks dramatic consequences if transparency and information flow issues are not addressed expeditiously during this health crisis.2\\n\", 'The virus will not only claim lives. Its spread will confront MENA countries with both a negative supply shock and a negative demand shock (Baldwin and Weder di Mauro, 2020).\\n', 'The negative supply shock comes first from a reduction in labor - directly because workers get sick with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, and indirectly due to travel restrictions, quarantine efforts and workers staying home to take care of sick family members or children. Supply will also be affected by a reduction in materials, capital and intermediate inputs due to disruptions in transport and businesses in MENA countries.\\n', \"The negative demand shock is both global and regional. Economic difficulties around the world and the disruption of global value chains will reduce demand for the region's goods and services, most notably oil and tourism. The reduction in GDP growth in China is expected to have a limited effect on tourism activity in MENA (Chart 1). That said, the spread of the virus to other countries, especially in Europe, and the preventive health measures they have taken is expected to have a much larger impact on MENA. Regional demand will also decline as the abrupt reduction in regional business activity and concerns about infection reduce travel. In addition, uncertainty about the spread of the virus and the level of aggregate demand would hurt the region's investment and consumption. Collapsing oil prices further depress demand in MENA, where oil and gas is the most important sector in many economies. Finally, potential financial market volatility could further disrupt aggregate demand._\\n\", '_\\n', 'The negative supply and demand shocks associated with COVID-19 are expected to be relatively short-lived, but dramatic, and to affect many sectors and countries. Demand and supply will recover once the pandemic subsides - and how quickly that occurs depends on the length and depth of the disruption.\\n', \"In addition to the shock from COVID-19, the breakdown in negotiations between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies led to what will likely be a persistent collapse in oil prices. On March 5, 2020, OPEC proposed a 1.5 million barrel per day (mb/d) production cut for the second quarter of 2020, of which 1 mb/d would come from OPEC countries and 0.5 mb/d from non-OPEC but aligned producers, most prominently Russia. The following day, Russia rejected the proposal, prompting Saudi Arabia - the world's largest oil exporter - to boost production to 12.3 mb/d, its full capacity. Saudi Arabia also announced unprecedented discounts of almost 20% in key markets. The result was an immediate drop of more than 30% in prices and continuing declines since. The benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price reached a low of $22.39 per barrel in the intraday session on March 20, 2020 - less than half the price at the beginning of the month. The futures curve suggests that the market expects oil prices to recover slowly - not reaching $40 per barrel until the end of 2022 (Chart 2). ntertwined but distinct\\n\", 'The two shocks of COVID-19 and oil price collapse are intertwined, yet distinct. On one hand, the demand component of the oil shock is linked to the sharp reduction in oil consumption stemming from precautionary measures to stop the spread of the virus, including lockdowns, which have brought economies around the world to a standstill. The estimated 10% reduction in oil consumption from 2019, or about 10 mb/d, is the result of reduced air and road travel, according to Rystad Energy, the Norwegian research company. While the depth and duration of the pandemic shock is uncertain, it is expected to be short-lived. Indeed, the severity of the shock has triggered unprecedented domestic measures in advanced and developing countries, and the imperative of global coordination to eradicate the virus will hopefully prevail. The international financial institutions are critical to the efforts of developing countries that have acute balance of payments or fiscal problems, and are now fighting COVID-19. These institutions, which can offer zero- to low-interest financing and long maturities, are best-equipped to help countries in MENA and other developing regions deal with the dual shock. The cost of inaction, both economic and social, would be large. The payoff for action is large. Previous experience in fighting smallpox suggested that the benefit-cost ratio for assisting its eradication of the disease exceeded 400-1 (Barrett, 2007).\\n', 'Once the spread of the virus is stopped, the preventive measures at the root of the economic recession will be rolled back. The speed of that recovery will depend on how swiftly and decisively governments take measures to mitigate the economic and financial dislocations from the health crisis. But the supply component of the oil shock is likely to be persistent and drive oil prices lower for longer. The two shocks differ in their duration but also their likely potential consequences and associated risks of inaction.\\n', 'When assessing the impact of oil prices on the global economy, economists typically distinguish between supply- and demand-driven oil shocks. Demand-driven shocks are related to the evolution of global demand and as such are not expected to have an independent effect on the global economy. But the supply-driven oil shocks would normally be expected to give an independent boost to the global economy. There are several reasons why they might not - in good part because the financial propagation effects of the collapse in oil prices have caused markets for equities, bonds, and non-oil commodities to tumble.\\n', 'For MENA countries specifically, lower prices are generally good for oil-importing countries and bad for oil exporters. A simple way to get a sense of the size of the real income effect of an oil price change is to multiply the difference between production and consumption (net oil export) as a share of GDP by the percentage point change in the oil price. For instance, based on hypothetical assumption that oil prices will stay 48% below the 2019 level, Kuwait - where net oil exports account for 43% of GDP - would experience a decline in real income of about 20% of GDP, while importer Morocco would experience an increase in real income equivalent to 3% of GDP (Chart 3).\\n', '_\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'But in MENA it is likely that lower oil prices will hurt both importers and exporters - exporters directly and importers indirectly from reduced foreign direct investment, remittances, tourism, and grants from exporters.3 4 Some countries, such as those in the Gulf Cooperation Council, still have buffers and should use them. Other oil-exporting countries, such as Algeria and Iran, are exhausting their buffers and will have to rely on flexible exchange rates to manage the current situation and conduct much needed reforms in private-sector development and broader economic transformation. Among net oil importers - such as Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon - a recession will worsen already high levels of public debt.\\n', 'Policy response_\\n', 'While COVID-19 has caused a severe supply shock that is expected to increase_unemployment and poverty, there is also a sizable feedback loop in terms of demand. Besides the loss of human lives, inaction also risks massive disruptions in supply and demand as well as illiquidity in the financial sector. In other words, the COVID-19 shock could lead to household and corporate bankruptcies, with lasting scars on the economy and society. The disruptions come at a time of discontent in MENA where the streets have been full of protests demanding better governance and an end to corruption.\\n', \"In contrast, the oil price collapse is a commodity terms-of-trade shock that affects the economy through reduced export receipts and revenues in government coffers. The shock is expected to be persistent and lead to widening twin deficits - in a country's current balance and its government budget - as well as increased debt if there is no fiscal consolidation.\\n\", 'To deal with the dual shock, authorities should sequence and tailor their responses to the severity of the shocks. They should focus first on responding to the health emergency and the associated risk of economic depression. Authorities should postpone the fiscal consolidation associated with the persistent drop in oil price and its spillovers until the recovery from the pandemic is well underway. In responding to COVID-19, authorities should boost spending on health - including producing or acquiring test kits, mobilizing and paying health workers, adding health infrastructure, and preparing for vaccination campaigns. The authorities should also use targeted cash transfers to vulnerable households and support the private sector, including small- and medium-sized enterprises in the informal sector.\\n', 'It is paramount to target the large number of workers in the informal sector, who have no safety net. Many of them work hand-to-mouth. Given the large labor share and borrowing constraints in many developing countries across MENA, targeted assistance is vital and should be larger relative to the economy than similar efforts in advanced economies. Successful models of quickly deploying the role of technology, including digital, to fight COVID-19 and target assistance should be analyzed and replicated.5_As mentioned earlier, freeing information flows, increasing transparency and data disclosure to reduce leakages are crucial elements in target cash transfers, which themselves will be essential to ensuring a flattening of the spread of the virus, hastening the economic recovery and limiting the rise in poverty. To limit risk of financial instability, countries in the MENA region should reduce interest rates and inject liquidity in the banking system. Where inflation is low, liquidity injection and targeted cash transfers can be financed by \"helicopter money,\" that is, essentially from money printed by central banks (Gali, 2020).\\n', 'The battle against the spread of the novel coronavirus and its economic and social consequences will be made more difficult by empty government coffers. Many MENA countries are facing large balance-of-payments and fiscal gaps. Many also carry high sovereign-risk premiums. For those countries, additional foreign borrowing on private markets will be difficult. Moreover, countries with fixed exchange rates will find it difficult to use helicopter money because of the tension between money printing and maintenance of the peg. The region will need much international support to help it navigate an extremely rough patch._Oil prices fell on Wednesday as investors worried about fuel demand due to fresh outbreaks of COVID-19, though prices drew some support after US stocks of diesel fuel fell for the first time in weeks and US oil production dropped sharply.However, the virus is spreading in parts of the United States, while scores of flights were cancelled and schools were shut in Beijing to head off a new virus outbreak in the Chinese city.\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\"We think the oil market is not currently pricing in a significant probability of either second waves of coronavirus cases in key consumers and the associated lockdowns, or anything less than a rapid return to economic business-as-usual,\" Standard Chartered analysts said.

The Kennedy Space Center was held at stage 3, after one member of the workforce tested positive. Due to mandatory telework policy already in effect, the individual had not been on site for over a week prior to symptoms.[citation needed] On May 18, the Michoud facility began to resume SLS work operations, but so far remains in a state of level 3.[53]\\n', 'At stage 4, mandatory telework is in effect for all personnel, with the exception of limited personnel required for mission-essential work and to care-take and maintain the safety and security of the facility.[54]\\n', 'ESA\\n', '_']\n",
